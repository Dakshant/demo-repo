In a Markdown file, users can use simple text formatting syntax to add headings, lists, bold and italic text, links, and other formatting elements.
To create a bulleted list, you can use an asterisk (*) followed by a space, like this:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

Markdown files can be easily converted into other formats such as HTML, PDF, or Word documents using various tools and software.
Overall, Markdown files are a simple and effective way to create well-formatted documents without the need for complex formatting tools or coding skills.
